          Of course New versions are released and it would be a chore to 

      Go to the Tool Thread looking for it, So why not bring the updates here!

         
          The "Check for Updates" Option, Checks whether the Tool you have
		     
           is the latest version out there. If its not, It downloads the 
			 
                 Newest version and stores it in UPDATE Directory
